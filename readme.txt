Add Braspag payment to your WooCommerce e-commerce!

== Description ==

Add Braspag gateway to WooCommerce.

[Braspag](https://www.braspag.com.br) is a Brazilian payment gateway.

### Development ###

This plugin was developer using the [official docs](https://braspag.github.io) of gateway, without any support.

None of developers have link with Braspag or WooCommerce.

### Payment Methods ###

- Bank Slip
- Credit Card

### Compatibility ###

We tested this plugin against version 4.1+ of WooCommerce.

This plugin do not require [Brazilian Market on WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-extra-checkout-fields-for-brazil/) but suggest your use.

Braspag only requires customer name, but more fields are need for anti fraud or other gateway features.

### Configuration ###

After installing the plugin, activate the payment method and go to the configuration page.

- Activate the payment method.
- Fill the title and description for this payment method.
- Add the "Merchant ID" provided by Braspag.
- Check the option "Sandbox" if the store is not in Production (available for real sale).
- Add the "Secret Merchant Key" provided by Braspag (note that it is different for Sandbox).

After that, just activate the available payment methods.

All of them require a "Provider" provided by Braspag and some settings: read the tips (icon with the question mark) for more information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it works with Gutenberg? =

Yes. WooCommerce supports WordPress 5+ and we too.

= Does it works for another e-commerce plugin? =

Nope. This is a WooCommerce extension.

= I cannot add a payment on order administration =

To create a payment on admin you should:

- Add a name to "billing address".
- Make sure order is not empty and not paid (needs payment).
- Transaction ID must be empty.

= Transaction ID? =

The transaction ID is the Braspag number on your order.

If you already have a Transaction ID (payment was done in Braspag) you must use the relative Order Action to get information from Braspag.

= My orders are not being updated automatically =

You should configure a URL to receive notification from Braspag.

It should be: "example.com/?wc-api=WC_Checkout_Braspag_Gateway"

Do not forget to change "example.com" to your home url.
